            Working with textiles is a great way to encourage creativity and
            help kids develop an artistic flair. Crochet or embroidery clubs are
            the easiest and safe way of sparking this interest - and is one of
            our favourite after school club ideas! For crochet clubs, it’s a
            great idea to start by teaching kids the basics of crocheting -
            starting with making chains or armbands. As your kids get more
            experienced, encourage them to make scarves or hats. Embroidery kits
            are relatively inexpensive and give kids a great canvas to express
            their creativity. You could get them to make badges, tea towels or
            work together to make larger pieces of art.

          <p class="card__text--par">
            Although origami is an art form that goes back over a thousand
            years, scientists only recently discovered why it remains so popular
            all around the globe. It turns out that the process of creating
            shapes using your hands engages both sides of the brain. So in
            addition to improving their motor skills, origami strongly
            stimulates students’ reasoning and increases their attention spans.
            Parents never fail to be impressed when their child folds them a
            rose out of a napkin. And kids are bound to be intrigued by the
            legend of 1,000 cranes.

            Gardening can be relaxing and fun for people of all ages, making it
            a great extracurricular activity idea for kids. It teaches patience
            and helps the kids to forge a stronger connection to nature. Teach
            them about planting, maintenance, composting, garden bugs and more!
            Kids can also learn lots about ecology, conservation, ecosystems and
            wildlife through a gardening club. Activities such as gardening will
            inevitably help promote an interest in nature and encourage kids to
            care more about the environment all around us!

            First and foremost, gymnastics provides a great foundation for all
            children whether they aspire to be an Olympic gymnast, a baseball
            player, or even an astronaut. Gymnastics, by its very definition, is
            the foundation of every sport as “physical exercises designed to
            develop strength and coordination.” Physical activity focused on
            developing gross motor skills and coordination help improve
            children’s cognitive brain growth and set children up for success in
            life

            Football is a fast moving game with a lot of variety. Players run,
            jump, quickly change direction, and stop and start, which improves
            cardiovascular health. Practice drills, complex running routes and
            defensive techniques all encourage speed, strength, and stamina. And
            these activities also engage motor skills, specifically hand and eye
            coordination. Plus, a recent study found that playing football has
            positive effects on bone strength.

            Learning the piano increases concentration, focus, discipline and
            patience! Children will need to focus on the instructions given by
            their piano tutor, and this learning process teaches them
            fundamental skills that help them listen, comprehend and react to
            information. Effectively, your children will be listening in one
            language and translating those instructions into action in another
            language, which is pretty amazing!
